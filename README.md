# üìå MyJobTracker Frontend

A React frontend built with **Vite** and **TailwindCSS** for tracking job applications. This app interacts with a **Spring Boot backend** to manage job applications.



## About This Project

This is one of my first attempts at building a full-stack application. As I am currently searching for entry-level positions, I wanted to create a better way to track my job applications from different sites. This project also serves as an opportunity to add a new project to my resume while gaining hands-on experience with various frameworks and practicing Java backend concepts.

It may be rough around the edges, but this is my first project of many like this outside of university. I‚Äôm constantly learning, improving, and refining my development skills. Feedback is always welcome!
